## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

Here's an **idea** for the **Web-Based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software**:

### **Idea: AI-Driven Smart Interview Simulator (AISIS)**

#### **Concept Overview**
AISIS is an **AI-powered interview simulation platform** that mimics a **real-life boardroom interview experience**. It ensures an unbiased, **data-driven selection process** by dynamically generating **relevant questions**, analyzing **candidate responses**, and providing **quantifiable scores** for each interview session.

---

### **Key Innovations in AISIS**
1. **Smart Question Generator (SQG)**  
   - Uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to generate **context-specific** questions based on the candidate's expertise.  
   - Adjusts the difficulty level based on **real-time candidate responses**.  
   - Supports **techno-managerial** question generation for higher-level candidates.

2. **AI-Powered Response Evaluator (ARE)**  
   - Analyzes candidate answers using **Machine Learning (ML)** models.  
   - Evaluates answers based on **relevance, depth, confidence, and coherence**.  
   - Detects **plagiarism or memorized answers** to ensure authenticity.

3. **Real-Time Interview Simulation**  
   - Simulates a **panel of expert interviewers** using AI avatars.  
   - Allows **video, audio, and text-based interactions**.  
   - Supports **live expert intervention** for manual assessment.

4. **Automated Scoring & Ranking System**  
   - Assigns a **quantifiable score** for each candidate based on:\n  
     - **Relevance** of answers to the field of expertise.  
     - **Depth & technical accuracy**.  
     - **Communication skills & confidence** (for video-based responses).  
   - Generates a **final suitability score** and ranks candidates accordingly.

5. **Secure & Scalable Platform**  
   - Supports **multi-user concurrent interviews**.  
   - Implements **role-based access control** for data security.  
   - Uses **blockchain-based audit trails** to prevent manipulation of scores.

### **Expected Benefits**
âœ… **Unbiased Candidate Evaluation** â€“ Ensures fairness by eliminating human bias.  
âœ… **Automated & Efficient Hiring** â€“ Reduces **manual workload** and speeds up the selection process.  
âœ… **Data-Driven Decision Making** â€“ Provides **insightful analytics** on candidate performance.  
âœ… **Scalable & Secure** â€“ Can be used across **multiple departments and organizations**.  

This AI-driven **interview simulation system** will revolutionize the recruitment process by **enhancing efficiency, fairness, and accuracy**. ðŸš€
